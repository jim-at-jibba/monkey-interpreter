# Lexical analysis

- To make our code easier to work with we must go through a process `Source Code -> Tokens -> AST`
- Te first transformation is called _lexing_. Done by a lexer or tokeniser
- Tokens are easy to categorise data strinctures which are fed to a parserwhich will turn the tokens into the AST
